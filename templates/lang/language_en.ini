HINT_1="<b>Step 1</b>:<br><br>Copy all your custom Icons into the folder <i><b>IconLibrary</b></i> using the filemanager above. Use an index / naming scheme like "0001.yourname.svg". Note! All indexes > 9000 are reserved!."
HINT_2="<b>Step 2 (<i>optional</i> - has to be done only once)</b>:<br><br>If you would like to include <a href='https://configurator.loxone.com' target='_blank'>Loxone's Touch Pure Flex Configurator</a> Icons (> 500 high quality icons) and some additional weather icons, you can add/remove them by using the following buttons (if you would like to add only some icons and not all, copy them from their folders into the folder <i>IconLibrary</i> using the filemanager above):"
HINT_3="<b>Step 3</b>:<br><br>Add your custom icons to the Miniserver's Icon Library. We will download the currently used Icon Library from your Niniserver (No. 1 in LoxBerry) and add your custom icons automatically."
HINT_4="<b>Step 4</b>:<br><br>Upload the new Icon Library to your Miniserver (Note! The Miniserver <b>will reboot</b> after upload!):"
HINT_5="<b>Step 5</b>:<br><br>Download the new Icon Library to your computer and save it to <i><b>C:\ProgramData\Loxone\Loxone Config &lt;latest&gt;</b></i> replacing the existing file. Both Loxone Config and the Miniserver should have the same copy of the library to ensure the custom icons are available in the app. Now you can add your custom icons to rooms, categories, status symbols, etc. (your icons can be found within ithe search with keyword 'custom')."
